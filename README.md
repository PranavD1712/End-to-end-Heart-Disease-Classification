This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict the presence of **heart disease** based on patient health records. It covers the full ML workflow — from data preprocessing and EDA to training, evaluation, and deployment-ready results.

---

## 🔑 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations 📊
- Data preprocessing: missing values, scaling, encoding
- Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation with metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**
- Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization
- Clean, reproducible notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains patient health indicators such as:
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise-Induced Angina
- ST Depression, Slope, Vessels, Thalassemia  

**Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** → ML models & evaluation
